# The Alan Dalton Memoirs Project

## About This Project

This repository contains a collection of personal memoirs written by Alan Dalton, a missionary who served in East Africa (Tanzania/Tanganyika) during the 1960s and 1970s with his wife Margaret and their children.

## Background

Alan Dalton wrote these stories with the intention of eventually writing a book about his experiences. While he ultimately set aside that ambition, he left behind a remarkable collection of vivid, detailed accounts of missionary life in East Africa during a tumultuous period in the region's history.

These memoirs capture:
- Adventure and danger in remote African locations
- Family life with young children in challenging circumstances
- Faith and providence in times of crisis
- Cross-cultural encounters and relationships
- The daily realities of missionary work
- Historical moments (political riots, postal strikes, the Suez Canal closure)

## The Stories

The collection includes numerous standalone stories, each complete in itself:

- **Freak Blizzard** - A harrowing December 1967 journey from England to Southampton to catch their ship to Africa
- **Lake Malawi** - Stranded miles from anywhere with two babies and a broken-down van
- **Hazel's Birth** - A daughter born with only 50/50 survival odds
- **Bush Fire** - Fighting to save their mission compound from an approaching inferno
- **Famine of Rent Money** - Six weeks without mail or money during the Great Post Office Strike
- **Midnight Journey** - A terrifying encounter with a violent mob during political riots
- **Pole-fishers** - The problem of thieves "fishing" for clothes through open windows
- **Quarantine Quarters** - The entire family quarantined for measles aboard ship
- **Holiday in the Game Reserve** - Safari adventures and mishaps at Ngorongoro Crater
- **Songo Songo** - A dangerous storm-tossed voyage to a remote island

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to:

1. Preserve these stories digitally for future generations
2. Identify common threads and themes that run through the narratives
3. Organize the stories in a coherent order (chronological, thematic, or narrative)
4. Create a cohesive book structure that honors Alan's original vision while making the stories accessible to modern readers
5. Potentially fill in gaps or add context where needed

## The Writing

Alan writes with:
- Vivid detail and strong imagery
- Humor in the face of adversity
- A clear narrative voice
- Religious faith as a throughline
- Respect for the African people he encountered
- Honesty about the challenges of missionary life

## Project Status

Currently in the initial phase of reading, cataloging, and understanding the full scope of the memoirs.
