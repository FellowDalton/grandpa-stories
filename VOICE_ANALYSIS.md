## 1. NARRATIVE STRUCTURE

### Opening Patterns
- **Starts with precise context**: Specific dates, locations, and circumstances
  - Example: "December 8th 1967 was a day much to be remembered."
  - Example: "'Saba saba' had ended; that is, the eight-day exhibition."

- **Sets the scene methodically**: Establishes who, where, when before the action
  - Often includes background information needed to understand the story
  - Provides specific details (distances, quantities, numbers)

### Story Development
- **Chronological progression**: Events unfold in order with clear time markers
  - "Eventually...", "At last...", "Next day...", "Then..."

- **Building tension naturally**: Lets circumstances speak for themselves
  - Doesn't overdramatize, but allows details to create drama
  - Example: Simply stating "We were stranded" rather than elaborating on fear

### Endings
- **Reflective conclusions**: Often ties back to faith or providence
  - "We had been truly 'under the eye of the Lord'"
  - "Once again we had reason to be thankful"

- **Sometimes abrupt**: Stories can end matter-of-factly after the resolution
  - No forced moral or lengthy reflection required

- **Dry humor in adversity**:
  - "And the smell! We got used to the noise but not the smell."
  - "Not again? But it was..."

### Humble and Grateful
- **Downplays accomplishments**: Focuses on God's provision rather than own efforts
- **Expresses thankfulness frequently**: "How thankful we were...", "With much relief..."
- **Acknowledges help from others**: Names people who assisted, shows appreciation

### Faith-Centered

We had left at dawn with our Cortina loaded with supplies for the children's camp—tinned foods, medical supplies, and Scripture Gift Mission literature in Swahili. Margaret had packed carefully, as always. The children, all five of them, were squeezed into the back seat. We had fourteen miles of tarmac road before reaching the dirt track."
