# The Hybrid Triptych/Sketchbook Approach: Detailed Guide

## Concept Overview

This approach combines the artistic structure of a **triptych painting** (three connected panels that tell one story) with the intimate, episodic nature of a **sketchbook** (individual drawings/stories that can stand alone but build to something greater).

### The Metaphor
Imagine your grandfather's art studio. On the wall hangs a large triptych - a three-panel painting showing his journey to Africa, life there, and return home. But lean closer, and you see each panel is actually composed of many smaller sketches, each a complete scene, together creating the larger picture. Scattered between the sketches are his artist's notes - brief reflections explaining technique, context, or meaning.

This is the structure of the book.

## The Three Panels (Parts)

### Panel One: "Leaving the Known World"
**Timeline:** December 1967 - January 1968
**Emotional Arc:** Anticipation → Chaos → Faith → Arrival
**Page Count:** ~60-80 pages
**Visual Metaphor:** Cool colors transitioning to warm - greys and whites of England/snow becoming golds and ochres of Africa

### Panel Two: "Living in Lion Country"
**Timeline:** 1968-1970s (bulk of mission work)
**Emotional Arc:** Wonder → Challenge → Danger → Perseverance → Grace
**Page Count:** ~150-200 pages
**Visual Metaphor:** Rich, vibrant palette - crimsons (danger), emeralds (beauty), deep blues (night), bright golds (provision)

### Panel Three: "The Return"
**Timeline:** Return journey and furlough
**Emotional Arc:** Transition → Reflection → Gratitude → Legacy
**Page Count:** ~40-60 pages
**Visual Metaphor:** Softer, reflective tones - twilight colors, memory hues

---

## Anatomy of Each Panel

Each panel contains:
1. **Panel Opening** - Brief introduction setting the scene (1-2 pages)
2. **Sketches** - Individual complete stories (3-8 pages each)
3. **Interludes** - Short reflective pieces between sketches (1-2 pages)
4. **Panel Closing** - Brief transition to next panel (1 page)

---

## PANEL ONE IN DETAIL: "Leaving the Known World"

### Panel Opening (2 pages)
*Written by you, setting the context*

> December 8th, 1967. A family of seven prepared to leave everything they knew - their homeland, their families, their security - to become missionaries in East Africa. My grandfather, an artist and painter, and my grandmother Margaret, a trained nurse, had five daughters ranging from teenagers to toddlers. They had fourteen pieces of hand luggage. They had faith.
>
> What they didn't know as they set out that morning was that this would be no ordinary journey. God, it seemed, had dramatic plans from the very first mile.
>
> These are the sketches from their departure - painted in my grandfather's own words.

### Sketch 1: "Freak Blizzard" (6-8 pages)
*His complete story, exactly as written*

- Opens with the title in his handwriting style (could even be actual scan)
- The full text of "Freak Blizzard"
- Maintains his voice, his pacing, his sensory details
- Ends with them boarding the ship

### Interlude 1: "On Leaving" (1-2 pages)
*Brief reflection providing context*

> **Interlude: What They Left Behind**
>
> In 1967, Britain was changing rapidly. The Beatles had just released "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." Color television was arriving in homes. England had won the World Cup the year before. The country was modern, comfortable, secure.
>
> East Africa was another world entirely. Tanzania had gained independence only six years earlier, in 1961. The country was still finding its footing, infrastructure was limited, and for European missionaries, the adjustment would be profound.
>
> My grandmother Margaret had trained as a nurse at Dundee Royal Infirmary in Scotland. My grandfather was a painter and craftsman. They were leaving careers, family, and everything familiar to live on faith-based support with five young children in a place where the nearest doctor might be hours away, where mail took weeks, and where "normal" would be redefined daily.
>
> The Freak Blizzard that delayed their departure would, in retrospect, seem providential. Had they sailed on schedule, they would have crossed the Tanzanian border in December 1967, when the car they purchased was new. Instead, they arrived in January 1968, when the car was a year old - and the customs duty rate was therefore affordable. They couldn't pay what they owed with cash. But God, who controlled even weather and calendar, had already made provision.
>
> This would become the pattern of their lives.

### Sketch 2: "The Cape to Cairo Road" (5-7 pages)
*His story of the journey from Cape Town north through Rhodesia, Zambia, to Tanzania*

- The 3,500-mile journey through multiple countries
- Crossing borders, the mysterious parcel "to be opened on the Tanzanian border"
- Meeting George Fundisha at the border
- The Asian friend who advanced them money
- Delivering the letter, stopping to help the injured man
- The rains beginning, sleeping in grass huts with lions roaring
- Wild lilies by Lake Malawi

### Interlude 2: "Maps and Borders" (1-2 pages)
*Historical/geographical context*

> **Interlude: The Hell Run**
>
> [Include a simple map showing the route from Cape Town to Dar-es-Salaam]
>
> The "Cape to Cairo Road" was Cecil Rhodes' dream - a continuous road running the length of Africa under British control. By 1968, when my grandfather drove it, the dream had fragmented. The road passed through newly independent nations, each with its own customs, politics, and challenges.
>
> The "Hell Run" from Kabwe to Dar-es-Salaam earned its name honestly. During the Rhodesian crisis and sanctions against South Africa, hundreds of petrol tankers had attempted this route. Many broke down. Some drivers died. The road became a graveyard of vehicles.
>
> That my grandparents, with five children including two babies, attempted this journey in a used Cortina station wagon seems almost reckless. That they made it through - overloaded, under-resourced, relying on strangers' kindness and divine providence - seems miraculous.
>
> The parcel they carried for George Fundisha, the Asian friend who advanced them money they couldn't repay, the precise timing that saved them customs fees - these weren't coincidences. They were the opening notes of a symphony of provision that would play throughout their years in Africa.

### Sketch 3: "First Days in Dar-es-Salaam" (4-6 pages)
*Arrival, finding George Fundisha's family, the tragedy, setting up in the new place*

- The joy of delivering presents
- Learning of George and Martha's deaths
- The six orphaned children
- First impressions of the city
- Reality setting in

### Interlude 3: "The Mission Ahead" (1 page)
*Brief transition*

> **Interlude: Looking Forward**
>
> They had arrived. The epic journey from Southampton to Dar-es-Salaam - through blizzard, sea, desert, and "hell run" - was complete. Now the real work would begin.
>
> Ahead lay years of missionary service in coastal Tanzania. There would be wonder and terror, provision and want, danger and deliverance. There would be moments when they'd wonder if they could continue, and moments when they couldn't imagine being anywhere else.
>
> The following sketches come from those years - the daily, weekly, yearly life of a missionary family in East Africa during the late 1960s and 1970s. Some moments were ordinary. Many were not.

### Panel Closing (1 page)
*Transition to Panel Two*

> The family settled into their new life in Kilwa Masoko on the coast. They found housing - first the crumbling Arab house with mortar dust falling from the ceiling, then other accommodations. They learned to live with heat, humidity, disease, and danger. They learned to trust.
>
> These are the stories from those years.

**Total Panel One Length:** ~50-70 pages

---

## PANEL TWO IN DETAIL: "Living in Lion Country"

This is the heart of the book - the longest panel, containing the most stories.

### Panel Opening (2 pages)

> Life in coastal Tanzania was unlike anything the family had known. The landscape, the climate, the culture, the daily challenges - everything was different. They lived where lions roared at night, where diseases could kill within days, where mail might take months to arrive.
>
> But they also lived where wild lilies bloomed beside vast lakes, where strangers showed extraordinary kindness, where faith became tangible and prayer wasn't abstract theology but daily necessity.
>
> My grandfather, the artist, saw it all with a painter's eye. His stories capture not just what happened, but how it felt, smelled, sounded, looked. Reading them, you're there - in the grass hut with lions circling, in the car surrounded by an angry mob, in the hospital praying over a baby with 50/50 survival odds.
>
> These sketches span several years. Some are terrifying. Some are funny. All are true.

### The Stories (arranged in rough chronological/thematic order)

#### Sketch 4: "Lake Malawi" (6-8 pages)
*The van breaking down, grass huts, lions, leopard, the driver's long absence*

#### Interlude 4: "On Isolation" (1-2 pages)
> **Interlude: Miles from Anywhere**
>
> [Discussion of isolation in mission work, no cell phones, limited communication, self-reliance]

#### Sketch 5: "Hazel's Birth" (7-9 pages)
*Margaret's difficult pregnancy, the journey to Nachingwea, the 50/50 odds, prayer, the saline drip, the owl*

#### Interlude 5: "On Prayer" (1-2 pages)
> **Interlude: When Faith Becomes Concrete**
>
> [Reflection on the nature of prayer in crisis, what it meant to kneel in that hospital lounge]

#### Sketch 6: "Bush Fire" (6-8 pages)
*The mission compound on fire, Margaret alone with babies, beating out flames on the roof*

#### Interlude 6: "Margaret's Story" (1-2 pages)
> **Interlude: The Unseen Strength**
>
> [Focus on Margaret - trained nurse, ran bush clinic, alone often, held the family together]
>
> Much of my grandfather's story centers on his travels and adventures. But the real hero of this story may be my grandmother Margaret. While he and colleagues traveled on safari distributing literature, she stayed home with small children in a house with a makuti palm roof, mortar dust falling from the ceiling, hundreds of bats lodged overhead.
>
> She ran a daily bush clinic - an enclosure of palm leaves under shade trees - treating locals with limited supplies and no backup. She boiled and strained water drawn from Lake Malawi, full of hippopotami. She battled dengue fever, malaria, and countless other tropical diseases while pregnant, while nursing, while caring for five daughters.
>
> When the bush fire came, she didn't panic. When the mob surrounded the car, she clung to the steering wheel while being pulled. When money ran out, she said "never again" to the butcher's flat - but went back anyway when needed.
>
> She was, in every sense, remarkable.

#### Sketch 7: "Famine of Rent Money" (7-9 pages)
*Forced from their home, the butcher's flat, flies and disinfectant, faith in provision*

#### Interlude 7: "The Economics of Faith" (1 page)
> **Interlude: Living on Gifts**
>
> [Explanation of faith-based missionary support, no guaranteed salary, dependent on gifts]

#### Sketch 8: "Midnight Journey" (7-9 pages)
*The Bible exhibition, driving home at midnight, the riot, the mob, divine intervention*

#### Interlude 8: "Tanzania in Transition" (1-2 pages)
> **Interlude: A Nation Finding Its Way**
>
> [Historical context - Tanzania post-independence, political tensions, Ujamaa, relationship between locals and expatriates]
>
> The incident my grandfather called "Midnight Journey" didn't happen in a vacuum. Tanzania in the late 1960s and early 1970s was a nation in transition. Independence had come in 1961, but building a nation from colonial territory was proving complex.
>
> Julius Nyerere, Tanzania's first president, promoted "Ujamaa" - African socialism built on traditional communal values. There was pride in independence, but also economic struggle and political tension. Foreign aid workers and missionaries were mostly welcome, but not universally. Some saw them as helpful. Others saw them as vestiges of colonialism.
>
> The riot that night - sparked by a taxi driver's death - wasn't about my grandparents personally. They were simply there, foreign, in the wrong place at the wrong moment. That a senior member of the mob pushed through to save them, told them to drive forward slowly, and created a gap for their escape - this speaks to the complexity of the situation.
>
> Violence and kindness, danger and deliverance, often came from the same community, sometimes in the same moment.

#### Sketch 9: "The Great Post Strike" (7-9 pages)
*Six weeks with no mail, reduced to last 100 shillings, provisions stolen, the emergency letter from France*

#### Interlude 9: "Connection in an Analog World" (1 page)
> **Interlude: When Letters Were Lifelines**
>
> [Discussion of postal system as only connection, no email/phone, weeks for delivery]

#### Sketch 10: "Pole-fishers" (5-7 pages)
*The humidity, pole-fishing at night, Margaret's bedspreads stolen, the humor*

#### Sketch 11: "Holiday in the Game Reserve" (8-10 pages)
*The journey to Ngorongoro Crater, wildlife, tsetse flies, the sump plug incident, "under the eye of the Lord"*

#### Interlude 10: "On Wonder" (1-2 pages)
> **Interlude: The Gift of Beauty**
>
> [Reflection on moments of wonder amid hardship - the wild lilies, giraffes, vast herds]

#### Sketch 12: "Songo Songo" (7-9 pages)
*Island honeymoon, second visit with colleague, camping, the storm, the journey home*

#### Interlude 11: "Dr. Livingstone, I Presume?" (1 page)
> **Interlude: Walking in Famous Footsteps**
>
> When the District Commissioner greeted my grandfather with "Dr Livingstone, I presume?" he was making more than a joke. He was connecting my grandfather to a long line of missionaries and explorers who had come to East Africa with faith, determination, and often inadequate preparation.
>
> David Livingstone had walked parts of this same coastline over a century earlier. He too had faced storms, disease, isolation, and danger. He too had relied on local guides and the kindness of strangers. He too had seen the beauty and terror of Africa.
>
> The comparison was both humbling and affirming.

### Panel Closing (1 page)

> The years passed. Children grew. The family adapted. There were countless other stories - daily victories and struggles that didn't make it into these written sketches. Clinic days and school runs. Safari trips and Sunday services. Ordinary days made extraordinary by location.
>
> But eventually, every mission term must end. Furlough called. The journey home beckoned - and it would prove as eventful as the journey out.

**Total Panel Two Length:** ~130-180 pages

---

## PANEL THREE IN DETAIL: "The Return"

### Panel Opening (2 pages)

> The return journey to Britain would prove as dramatic as the outward journey had been. Different dramas - not blizzards but measles, not riots but the closure of the Suez Canal - but dramas nonetheless.
>
> And woven through it all was the question every missionary family faces: after years away, can you ever truly go "home" again?

### Sketch 13: "Quarantine Quarters" (7-9 pages)
*Hazel's measles on the ship, quarantine for the whole family, the Suez Canal, the last passenger ship through, the Naval escort*

#### Interlude 12: "The Last Ship Through" (1-2 pages)
> **Interlude: Historical Footnote**
>
> [Historical context about Suez Canal closure, Six-Day War, stranded merchant vessels, significance of being last passenger ship through]
>
> In 1967, during the Six-Day War between Israel and Arab nations, Egypt closed the Suez Canal. Fifteen merchant ships were caught inside - they would remain trapped for eight years, their crews eventually forming a unique community in the Bitter Lakes.
>
> My grandparents' ship, returning from East Africa, was the last passenger vessel to pass through before the closure. They didn't know it at the time. They were focused on quarantine, on German measles, on keeping children entertained in cramped quarters under the dog deck while the ship rolled in rough seas.
>
> But years later, realizing they'd been part of that historical moment - that God's timing had once again placed them exactly where they needed to be, when they needed to be there - added another layer of wonder to an already remarkable journey.
>
> Had they sailed earlier, they might have been trapped. Had they sailed later, they would have had to go around Africa's west coast, adding weeks to an already difficult journey.
>
> The timing was perfect. Again.

### Sketch 14: "The Great Post Strike" (reprise if not in Panel 2)
*Or another story about settling back in Britain, culture shock, Joyce's birth*

### Sketch 15: "A Home of Their Own" (3-4 pages)
*The handwritten letter about finding the house in Bath, looking back, gratitude*

### Interlude 13: "Legacy" (2-3 pages)
*Written by you - what happened after, the impact, why these stories matter*

> **Interlude: Why These Stories Matter**
>
> [Personal reflection on his legacy, what you learned from these stories, why you compiled them]
>
> My grandfather wrote these stories late in life, looking back over decades. He wrote them in his own hand, carefully, artistically. He wrote them so we would remember.
>
> Not just the facts - though the facts are fascinating - but the faith. The seeing God's hand in blizzards and blunders, in provision and protection, in timing too perfect to be coincidence.
>
> He wrote them as a painter paints - with careful attention to detail, to color, to light and shadow. Each story is a complete scene. Together they form a larger picture: a life lived in radical dependence on God, in service to others, in a place far from home.
>
> Reading them now, I'm struck by several things:
>
> 1. **The courage it took** - to leave Britain with five children, limited funds, and faith
> 2. **The resilience they showed** - adapting to heat, disease, danger, isolation
> 3. **The humor they maintained** - even in telling stories about pole-fishers and stolen bedspreads
> 4. **The grace they experienced** - again and again, provision came just when needed
> 5. **The impact they had** - running clinics, distributing literature, serving communities
>
> These stories aren't just family history. They're a testimony to what's possible when ordinary people say yes to an extraordinary calling.

### Panel Closing / Epilogue (2-3 pages)

> My grandfather lived a long life after returning from Africa. He and Margaret eventually settled in Bath, in the house they wrote about in that handwritten letter. They continued in ministry. They watched children and grandchildren grow. They remembered Africa with fondness and gratitude.
>
> The paintings he created - both with brush on canvas and with words on paper - remain. They remind us that life is an adventure when lived in faith, that God is present in blizzards and bush fires, that provision comes in mysterious ways, and that every journey - even the difficult ones - is "under the eye of the Lord."
>
> These are his stories. These are his paintings.
> This was his life.

**Total Panel Three Length:** ~40-60 pages

## Writing the Interludes: Practical Guide

### Length
- Most interludes: 1-2 pages (300-600 words)
- Some key interludes: 2-3 pages (600-900 words)
- Keep them concise - they're rests between movements, not movements themselves

### Tone
- Respectful and reflective
- Informative but not academic
- Personal but not intrusive
- Bridges his voice and contemporary readers

### Content Types

**Historical Context Interludes:**
- Tanzania in the 1960s-70s
- Suez Canal closure
- Missionary work in that era
- Medical challenges of the time

**Geographical Context Interludes:**
- Maps and distances
- Climate and terrain
- Wildlife and environment
- Infrastructure (or lack thereof)

**Personal Reflection Interludes:**
- What faith meant in practice
- Margaret's crucial role
- Family dynamics
- Long-term impact

**Technical/Practical Interludes:**
- How faith-based support worked
- Postal system as lifeline
- Medical realities (dengue, malaria, etc.)
- Daily life logistics

### What Interludes Should NOT Do:
- ❌ Overshadow the stories
- ❌ Explain what's already clear
- ❌ Interrupt narrative flow unnecessarily
- ❌ Insert modern political commentary
- ❌ Psychoanalyze or reinterpret
- ❌ Apologize for or "correct" his perspective

### What Interludes SHOULD Do:
- ✅ Provide helpful context
- ✅ Bridge time gaps between stories
- ✅ Offer historical/cultural background
- ✅ Highlight themes readers might miss
- ✅ Connect past and present
- ✅ Honor his voice while adding depth

---

## Visual Design Considerations

### Chapter/Section Headings
- Use typeface that evokes typewriter/handwriting
- Or scan actual handwritten titles from his originals
- Keep design clean and classic

### Interlude Markers
- Different typeface or styling to distinguish from sketches
- Perhaps italicized or in a sidebar
- Visual cue that says "this is commentary, not original story"

### Sketch Beginnings
- Each story starts on fresh page (or right-hand page)
- Title prominent
- Perhaps a small graphic element (paintbrush stroke?)

### Panel Divisions
- Clear visual separation between panels
- Perhaps full-page image or graphic
- Map showing that panel's geography

### Integration of Visuals
- If you have his paintings: use them as panel dividers
- If you have photos: photo section in center, or scattered through text
- If you have the actual emergency letter envelope (page 21 of PDF): include as image
- Maps showing journeys
- Perhaps small decorative elements reflecting African art/patterns

## Sample Opening Pages

Here's how the book might actually open:

---

**[Title Page]**

# UNDER THE EYE OF THE LORD
## Sketches from a Missionary's Life in East Africa

By Allan [Last Name]
*Compiled and with interludes by [Your Name]*

---

**[Dedication Page]**

*For Margaret,
who stayed home with the children while I traveled,
who ran the clinic while I distributed literature,
who never complained though she had every right to,
and whose faith proved stronger than mine
on the darkest nights.*

---

**[Introduction: The Painter's Eye - excerpt]**

My grandfather was a painter. Not a famous one - you won't find his work in galleries or museums. But his art was real, careful, observant. He saw the world in colors and compositions. He noticed light on water, shadow under trees, the texture of makuti palm thatch, the precise hue of a blizzard turning to snow.

When he sat down late in life to write his memories of missionary work in East Africa, he wrote the way he painted: with attention to detail, to atmosphere, to the truth of what he'd seen and felt. Reading his stories, you're not just learning what happened. You're there - in the car surrounded by an angry mob, in the grass hut with lions circling, at the border crossing where a mysterious parcel contains exactly what you need at exactly the right moment.

These are his stories, his sketches from a life lived far from home, in faith and in service. I've compiled them here, adding brief interludes to provide context and connection. But the heart of this book is his voice, his vision, his memories.

Like a triptych painting, the book unfolds in three panels: the journey out, the years in Africa, and the return home. Each panel contains individual sketches - complete stories that stand alone but together create a larger picture.

This is that picture. This is his art.
